# Workflow Triggers Configuration
# ========================================================================
# This is a starter template, so branches are commented out by default.
# Uncomment and configure the branches according to your project needs:
#
# For example:
#   push:
#     branches: [ main, develop ]
#   pull_request:
#     branches: [ main, develop ]
#
# Or for a single branch:
#   push:
#     branches: [ main ]
#   pull_request:
#     branches: [ main ]
# ========================================================================
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
