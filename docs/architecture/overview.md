## Why Clean Architecture?

Clean Architecture, popularized by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), provides a way to structure applications so that:

1. **Business logic is independent** of frameworks, UI, and external systems
2. **Dependencies point inward** - outer layers depend on inner layers, not vice versa
3. **Testability is built-in** - business logic can be tested without UI or network
4. **Maintainability is improved** - clear boundaries make changes easier
5. **Scalability is supported** - new features can be added without affecting existing code

### The Core Problem It Solves

Traditional Flutter apps often mix concerns:
- Business logic in widgets
- Network calls directly in UI
- Database access scattered throughout
- Hard to test without running the entire app
- Difficult to change frameworks (e.g., switching from Provider to Riverpod)

Clean Architecture solves this by enforcing **separation of concerns** and **dependency inversion**.

## Architecture Layers

This template follows Clean Architecture with four main layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Presentation Layer (UI)           │
│  - Screens, Widgets, Providers     │
│  - State Management (Riverpod)      │
│  - User Interactions               │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               │ Depends on
┌──────────────▼──────────────────────┐
│      Domain Layer                   │
│  - Entities (Business Objects)      │
│  - Use Cases (Business Logic)       │
│  - Repository Interfaces            │
│  - Framework-free, Pure Dart        │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               │ Depends on
┌──────────────▼──────────────────────┐
│      Data Layer                     │
│  - Models (Data Transfer Objects)    │
│  - Data Sources (Remote & Local)    │
│  - Repository Implementations       │
│  - Framework-specific (Dio, etc.)  │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               │ Depends on
┌──────────────▼──────────────────────┐
│      Core Layer                     │
│  - Network (ApiClient, Dio)         │
│  - Storage (SharedPrefs, Secure)    │
│  - Configuration (AppConfig)         │
│  - Utilities (Result, Validators)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Layer Responsibilities

#### 1. Presentation Layer
**Location:** `lib/features/*/presentation/`

**Responsibilities:**
- UI components (screens, widgets)
- State management (Riverpod providers)
- User input handling
- Navigation
- Error display

**Dependencies:**
- ✅ Domain layer (use cases, entities)
- ✅ Flutter framework
- ✅ Riverpod

**Should NOT:**
- ❌ Make direct network calls
- ❌ Access storage directly
- ❌ Contain business logic

#### 2. Domain Layer
**Location:** `lib/features/*/domain/`

**Responsibilities:**
- Business logic (use cases)
- Business entities (pure Dart classes)
- Repository interfaces (contracts)
- Domain-specific validation

**Dependencies:**
- ✅ Pure Dart (no Flutter, no frameworks)
- ✅ Core utilities (Result, Failures)

**Should NOT:**
- ❌ Depend on any framework
- ❌ Know about UI or data sources
- ❌ Import Flutter or external packages

#### 3. Data Layer
**Location:** `lib/features/*/data/`

**Responsibilities:**
- Data models (JSON serialization)
- Remote data sources (API calls)
- Local data sources (cache)
- Repository implementations

**Dependencies:**
- ✅ Domain layer (implements repository interfaces)
- ✅ Core layer (ApiClient, Storage)
- ✅ Dio, SharedPreferences, etc.

**Should NOT:**
- ❌ Contain business logic
- ❌ Know about UI

#### 4. Core Layer
**Location:** `lib/core/`

**Responsibilities:**
- Infrastructure (network, storage, config)
- Shared utilities (Result, validators)
- Error handling (exceptions, failures)
- Dependency injection setup

**Dependencies:**
- ✅ External packages (Dio, Riverpod, etc.)
- ✅ Platform-specific code

---

## Benefits

### 1. **Testability**

Business logic lives in the domain layer (pure Dart), making it easy to test:

```dart
// Domain layer - no mocks needed for business logic
test('LoginUseCase validates email format', () {
  final useCase = LoginUseCase(mockRepository);
  final result = await useCase('invalid-email', 'password');
  expect(result, isA<ResultFailure<ValidationFailure>>());
});
```

**Without Clean Architecture:**
- Need to mock Flutter widgets
- Need to mock network calls
- Hard to test business logic in isolation

### 2. **Maintainability**

Clear boundaries make it easy to:
- Find where code lives (feature → layer → file)
- Understand dependencies (inner layers don't depend on outer)
- Make changes without breaking other parts

**Example:** Changing state management from Riverpod to Bloc:
- Only affects Presentation layer
- Domain and Data layers unchanged
- Business logic remains intact

### 3. **Scalability**

Adding new features follows a consistent pattern:

```
lib/features/new_feature/
├── domain/
│   ├── entities/
│   ├── repositories/
│   └── usecases/
├── data/
│   ├── datasources/
│   ├── models/
│   └── repositories/
└── presentation/
    ├── screens/
    ├── widgets/
    └── providers/
```

Each feature is self-contained and doesn't affect others.

### 4. **Framework Independence**

Business logic doesn't depend on Flutter or external packages:

```dart
// Domain layer - could work in Dart CLI, web, mobile
class LoginUseCase {
  Future<Result<User>> call(String email, String password) {
    // Pure business logic - no Flutter, no Dio, no Riverpod
  }
}
```

This means:
- Easy to port to other platforms
- Easy to reuse business logic
- Easy to test without Flutter

### 5. **Team Collaboration**

Different team members can work on different layers:
- UI developers → Presentation layer
- Backend developers → Data layer
- Business analysts → Domain layer (use cases)

---

## Trade-offs

### 1. **Initial Complexity**

**Cost:** More files and boilerplate initially

**Example:**
- Simple app: 1 file with everything
- Clean Architecture: 10+ files per feature

**Mitigation:**
- Use code generation (Freezed, build_runner)
- Follow consistent patterns
- Use this template as a starting point

### 2. **Learning Curve**

**Cost:** Team needs to understand Clean Architecture

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive documentation (this file!)
- Code examples in the template
- Clear naming conventions

### 3. **Over-engineering for Small Apps**

**Cost:** Too much structure for simple apps

**When it's worth it:**
- Apps that will grow
- Team projects
- Long-term maintenance

**When to skip:**
- Prototypes
- One-off scripts
- Very simple apps (< 5 screens)

### 4. **More Abstraction Layers**

**Cost:** More indirection (use case → repository → data source)

**Benefit:**
- Easier to test
- Easier to change implementations
- Clearer separation of concerns

**Balance:**
- Use for complex features
- Simplify for trivial operations

### 5. **File Count**

**Cost:** More files to navigate

**Benefit:**
- Easier to find specific code
- Better IDE navigation
- Clearer organization

**Mitigation:**
- Use IDE features (Go to Symbol, Find in Files)
- Follow consistent naming
- Use feature-based organization

---

## When to Consider Alternatives

### Alternative Architectures

#### 1. **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**
**When to use:**
- Simple apps with minimal business logic
- Team familiar with MVC
- Quick prototypes

**Trade-offs:**
- ❌ Business logic often mixed with UI
- ❌ Harder to test
- ✅ Simpler structure
- ✅ Faster initial development

#### 2. **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**
**When to use:**
- Apps with complex UI state
- Team familiar with MVVM
- Need for data binding

**Trade-offs:**
- ❌ Less separation than Clean Architecture
- ❌ ViewModels can become bloated
- ✅ Good for UI-heavy apps
- ✅ Clear separation of UI and logic

#### 3. **Feature-First (No Clean Architecture)**
**When to use:**
- Small to medium apps
- Simple features
- Rapid iteration

**Trade-offs:**
- ❌ Business logic can leak into UI
- ❌ Harder to test
- ✅ Faster development
- ✅ Less boilerplate

#### 4. **Layered Architecture (Simpler)**
**When to use:**
- Medium complexity apps
- Want some structure but not full Clean Architecture
- Gradual migration path

**Structure:**
```
lib/
├── models/
├── services/
├── screens/
└── widgets/
```

**Trade-offs:**
- ❌ Less strict boundaries
- ❌ Can mix concerns
- ✅ Simpler than Clean Architecture
- ✅ Still organized
